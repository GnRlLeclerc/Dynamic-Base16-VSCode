# ðŸŽ¨ Dynamic Base16 VSCode theme

A simple VSCode extension to dynamically change VSCode's theme based on a json theme file or a json base16 colors file.
Made to work in tandem with [Flavours](https://github.com/Misterio77/flavours).

Inspired from [dlasagno/vscode-wal-theme](https://github.com/dlasagno/vscode-wal-theme).

Made for Linux be default, but should work on other platforms by tweaking the paths settings.
